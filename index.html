								I have strived to create an authentic account of life in Warsaw at the time. Most of the events in the book actually happened: the bombardment of Warsaw that ignited World War II, the creation of the Jewish Ghetto, the rescue operation at the zoo, the establishment of a pig farm and even the 1939 football match between Poland and Hungary. Most of the characters are real, including: Jan and Antonina Zabinski, Simon and Lonia Tenenbaum, Lutz Heck, Janusz Korczak and Ziegler, the German soldier. I have tried to depict them as accurately as possible, but inevitably they do and say some things in this book that they didn’t in real life. <br/><br/>It is estimated that the Zabinskis sheltered about 300 Jews in the basement of their villa and the empty cages of their zoo. The operation was code-named “The House under a Crazy Star”– which was the inspiration for the idea of inventing the Star of David on the outside wall of the villa (the image of a battered bullet-peppered metal star reflecting the sunlight ever stronger has been with me from the moment I first read that phrase). 
							</div>
							<div class="copyslider">
								Although the characters of Marcus and Stefan are also my own creation, they symbolise the many real examples of friendship that spanned the Jewish and non-Jewish communities of Warsaw.<br/><br/>It is true that at the time, the vast majority of people didn’t endanger themselves like the Zabinskis by acting to save Jewish lives, but it has always been the case that dictators can only succeed when the silent majority are too afraid to protest. Before we pass judgement on those that looked the other way we need to consider what we would have done in such circumstances. I have asked myself this question may times and I honestly doubt that I would have had Jan and Antonina’s courage. They, alongside over 6000 other fellow Poles, have been honoured by Yad Vashem (the Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority in Jerusalem) as “Righteous Among the Nations” – and it is certain that many more anonymous heroes performed deeds that history has never recorded. This book has been written in their honour as well.

								Before World War II Warsaw was one of the most beautiful cities in Europe. Its 	rich history was reflected in the variety of architectural styles of the buildings that lined its wide sweeping boulevards. In 1939 Jews made up 30% of its 1.3 million population. By the end of the war the city had lost almost a million of its inhabitants.

						<div class="warsawcopy">
							<div class="mapplace">The Ghetto</div>
							Warsaw’s was the largest of the many Jewish Ghettos that the Nazis established across Europe.  It was completed and sealed off from the rest of the city in November 1940. Almost half a million Jews were forced to live in its 3.5 square miles, leading to inevitable suffering that resulted in many deaths through starvation and disease. In 1942 the Germans started the transportations that would see practically all of the ghetto’s residents perish in the death camp at Treblinka.

       		 	After defeat in World War One the German economy collapsed, making most people in the country poor. Hitler and his Nazi party exploited the overwhelming sense of injustice felt in the country and concentrated their anger on the search for a scapegoat. <br/><br/><br/><br/>
       		 	By the time he became chancellor in 1933 the “enemies of the state” had been clearly identified – communists, socialists, liberals and ‘big business’.  But, so their argument went, behind all those groups, manipulating things for their own gain, were the Jews.

       		 	Hitler started to imprison all <br/>political opponents in “concentration camps” in 1933. <br/>This picture was taken in Dachau, one of the earliest camps, which was to become a model for the camps that were built in the years to come.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Jewish literature was designated as “un-German” and numerous book-burning ceremonies took place – Hitler was sending the message that the country had to cleanse itself of all Jewish influence.

       		 	He wanted the country to <br/>aspire to the “Aryan” ideal.<br/> Racial purity was at the heart of<br/> his dream of a greater Germany and a variety of scientific methods were devised to measure whether or not you belonged.  <br/><br/>Although Jews were the main target for this policy of state sponsored racial discrimination, they were by no means the only group who were considered unworthy to be part of the pure Aryan “master race” that Hitler dreamt of. Thousands of gypsies were imprisoned and killed, along with homosexuals and the mentally ill.

       		 	Such brutality fostered a deep <br/>sense of fear in German <br/>society.  Opposing what was <br/>going on was a risky, potentially suicidal thing to do. It was far easier to turn a blind eye to these atrocities than to speak out about them.  <br/><br/>The Nazis introduced a series of laws that gradually restricted the roles that Jews could play in German society. Ritual public humiliation of Jews became a common sight, making it easier to see Jews as inferior and subhuman. Anti-Semitism became official state policy – according to Hitler the  only way to be a loyal, patriotic German was to hate Jews.

His aim was to create a German-dominated Europe that would be a one party state of which he would be the leader. To achieve that he began invading neighbouring countries.

In September 1939, not heeding Britain’s warning that invading Poland would result in them declaring war, Hitler unleashed the devastating fire power he had built up during the previous years.  <br/><br/><br/>The more countries Hitler invaded, the larger the number of Jews there was “to deal” with.

Many thousands of Jews had already lost their lives, but the rate of murder was about to accelerate hugely and ever more “efficient” methods of killing Jews were devised.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>The most notorious of these camps was Auschwitz. It is estimated that out of the six million Jews that died in the Holocaust, over a million of them died in this dreadful place. When inmates arrived at the camp they were greeted by a sign that said “work sets you free” .

Many times I tried to analyse the causes for dislike of Jews and I could not find any, besides artificially formed ones.”

       		 		Antony Lishak is an author of over 30 children’s books and is widely known for leading inspirational writing workshops in schools across the UK and Europe. After sixteen years as a teacher he left to concentrate on empowering children to see themselves as authors and has since worked in over 2000 schools.<br/><br/>STARS is different from anything else he has written. It is the first book that draws directly from his Jewish heritage and is inspired by an act of selfless generosity by his grandfather that sadly only came to light after his death.    <br/><br/>STARS is a work of historical fiction; Antony sees himself more as a story teller than a historian. A considerable amount of research has gone into the creation of this book as it was absolutely crucial that the major events were reflected as accurately as possible and that the characters (both real and invented) behaved authentically.   <br/><br/>
       		 		Here are some suggestions for those who wish to find out more about the characters and events in the book.

       		 		Although Irena Sendler does not feature in STARS her amazing story sits perfectly alongside it. She was a Polish health worker who arranged for about 2500 Jewish children and babies to be smuggled out of the ghetto to safety. By pure coincidence her story briefly merges with the Zabinskis’ - she was given shelter in the zoo, for one night, when hiding from the Gestapo. Her story has been recorded in many books and in the film “The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler”.
