								I have strived to create an authentic account of life in Warsaw at the time. Most of the events in the book actually happened: the bombardment of Warsaw that ignited World War II, the creation of the Jewish Ghetto, the rescue operation at the zoo, the establishment of a pig farm and even the 1939 football match between Poland and Hungary. Most of the characters are real, including: Jan and Antonina Zabinski, Simon and Lonia Tenenbaum, Lutz Heck, Janusz Korczak and Ziegler, the German soldier. I have tried to depict them as accurately as possible, but inevitably they do and say some things in this book that they didn’t in real life.

								villa and the empty cages of their zoo. The operation was code-named “The House under a Crazy Star”– which was the inspiration for the idea of inventing the Star of David on the outside wall of the villa (the image of a battered bullet-peppered metal star reflecting the sunlight ever stronger has been with me from the moment I first read that phrase). Although the characters of Marcus and Stefan are also my own creation, they symbolise the many real examples of friendship that spanned the Jewish and non-Jewish communities of Warsaw.

							Warsaw, Poland’s capital city, sits on the Vistula, a river that runs the length of the country. Before World War II it was seen as one of the most beautiful cities in Europe. Its rich one thousand year history was reflected in the variety of architectural styles of the buildings that lined its wide sweeping boulevards. In 1939 Jews made up 30% of its 1.3 million population. By the end of the war the city had lost almost a million of its inhabitants.  
							Warsaw’s was the largest of the many Jewish Ghettos that the Nazis established across Europe.  
						</div>
						<div class="warsawcopy">
							The perimeter wall was completed and sealed off from the rest of the city in November 1940. Almost half a million Jews were forced to live in its 3.5 square miles, leading to inevitable suffering that resulted in many deaths through starvation and disease. In 1942 the Germans started the transportations that would see practically all of the ghetto’s residents perish in the death camp at Treblinka. The Germans charged Warsaw’s Jewish Community for the ghetto’s construction costs and its walls were built by forced work parties of Jews.

       		 	After defeat in World War One the German economy collapsed, making most people in the country poor. Hitler and his NAZI party exploited the overwhelming sense of injustice felt in the country and concentrated their anger on the search for a scapegoat. <br/><br/>
       		 	By the time he became chancellor in 1933 the “enemies of the state” had been clearly identified – communists, socialists, liberals and ‘big business’.  But, so their argument went, behind all those groups, manipulating things for their own gain, were the Jews.

       		 	Hitler started to imprison all political opponents in “concentration camps” in 1933. This picture was taken in Dachau, one of the earliest camps, which was to become a model for the camps that were built in the years to come.<br/><br/>Jewish literature was designated as “un-German” and numerous book-burning ceremonies took place – Hitler was sending the message that the country had to cleanse itself of all Jewish influence.

       		 	He wanted the country to <br/>aspire to the “Aryan” ideal.<br/> Racial purity was at the heart of<br/> his dream of a greater Germany and a variety of scientific methods were devised to measure whether or not you belonged.  <br/><br/>Although Jews were the main target for this policy of state sponsored racial discrimination, they were by no means the only group who were considered unworthy to be part of the pure Aryan “master race” that Hitler dreamt of. Thousands of gypsies were imprisoned and killed, along with homosexuals and the mentally ill.

       		 	Such brutality fostered a deep <br/>sense of fear in German <br/>society.  Opposing what was <br/>going on was a risky, potentially suicidal thing to do. It was far easier to turn a blind eye to these atrocities than to speak out about them.  <br/><br/>The Nazis introduced a series of laws that gradually restricted the roles that Jews could play in German society. Ritual public humiliation of Jews became a common sight, making it easier to see Jews as inferior and subhuman. Anti-Semitism became official state policy – according to Hitler the  only way to be a loyal, patriotic German was to hate Jews.

       		 	Things came to a head <br/>in November 1938. On what <br/>has become known as <br/>“Kristallnacht” waves of organised mobs destroyed 7,500 Jewish shops, burnt half of the country’s synagogues, killed 91 Jews and injured countless others. 20,000 Jews were sent to concentration camps and, afterwards, the Jewish community was fined for the damage. <br/><br/>Throughout the 1930s Hitler invested huge amounts of money into equipping his army. His aim was to create a German-dominated Europe that would, in effect, be a one party state of which he would be the leader. To achieve that he started to invade neighbouring countries.

       		 	Austria and Czechoslovakia fell without the need to open fire<br/> but it was the invasion of Poland that ignited the continent. In September 1939, not heeding Britain’s warning that invading Poland would result in them declaring war, Hitler unleashed the devastating fire power he had built up during the previous years.  <br/><br/>The more land Hitler took control of, the bigger the number of Jews he had to deal with became. It was as important to deal with the “Jewish problem” as it was to expand the area of Europe he controlled.

These were designed to humiliate the wearers, but as time moved on they were used as a marker to make deportation even easier. Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto were made to wear a blue star.

       		 	Across Europe Jews were <br/>herded together into Ghettos, <br/>of which Warsaw’s was the <br/>largest. These were unbearably over crowded places where deprivation, disease, starvation and cold blooded brutality caused unimaginable suffering. <br/><br/>To the NAZIs these “sub-human” Jews were becoming a nuisance. They were a time wasting, expensive burden that needed to be dealt with. Eventually the Ghettos just became holding pens from which the deportations would take place.

       		 	Hitler, along with the other <br/>leaders of the NAZI party,<br/> decided to expand the existing network of concentration camps. Many thousands of Jews had already lost their lives, but the rate of murder was about to accelerate hugely and ever more “efficient” methods of killing Jews were devised.  <br/><br/>The most notorious of these camps was Auschwitz. It is estimated that out of the six million Jews that died in the Holocaust, over a million of them died in this dreadful place. When inmates arrived at the camp they were greeted by a sign that said “work sets you free” .
